# Data-Science-Tools-and-Ecosystem
This notebook provides a brief summary of the Data Science tools and ecosystem. It covers the popular Data Science languages, commonly used libraries, Data Science tools, and arithmetic expressions in Python.
Introduction

In this notebook, we have summarized the Data Science Tools and Ecosystem. We have discussed the popular languages used in Data Science, commonly used libraries in Data Science, and some Data Science tools.
Objectives

The objectives of this notebook are:

    To list popular languages for Data Science
    To identify commonly used libraries in Data Science
    To introduce arithmetic expressions in Python
    To convert units of time from minutes to hours
    To provide an overview of Data Science tools and ecosystems

Data Science Languages

Data Scientists use different programming languages for Data Science, and some of the popular languages are Python, R, and SQL.
Data Science Libraries

Data Scientists use different libraries for Data Science, and some of the commonly used libraries are NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Data Science Tools

Data Science Tools are software applications that help Data Scientists in their work. Some of the commonly used Data Science tools are Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and RStudio.
Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic expressions are used in Data Science for calculations, and Python provides a powerful way to evaluate these expressions. Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

python

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3 * 4) + 5

17

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
200 / 60
